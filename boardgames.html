    <dl class="">
      <dt>Settler's of Cataan</dt>
      <dd>Obligatory classic, most people can pick up easily.</dd>
      <dt>Terraforming Mars</dt>
      <dd>Longer game, has engine building elements. Personal favorite, but takes a while.</dd>
      <dt>Spirit Island</dt>
      <dd><em>Cooporative</em> game, which is rare. Very enjoyable, run around as spirits protecting an island from invaders.</dd>
      <dt>Root</dt>
      <dd>A war game whose different factions play very different games. Much love to the Vagabond.</dd>
      <dt>Twilight Imperium <em>(the remake)</em></dt>
      <dd>Much like Terraforming Mars, very interesting, but requires more of a time commitment. Like Root, the different factions can play very differently.</dd>
